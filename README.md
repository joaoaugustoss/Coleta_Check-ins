# Coleta Check-ins

The number of people using social media is growing every day, and as a result, the amount of data available about users is also increasing. Currently, about $4,8$ billion people use social media worldwide, which is approximately $59$\% of the global population. Given this scenario, the literature contains works that address techniques for data collection and sampling from social media, allowing for the interpretation of such data for analysis in different domains, such as urban mobility, region classification, among others. This study utilizes Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) to analyze human mobility within urban centers. Check-ins collected from around the world were used to identify distinct behavior patterns among inhabitants from different regions of the planet, based on the concentration of records in specific locations. The results indicate that, despite the disparity in the spatial distribution of the data, LBSNs are capable of depicting the reality of cities, even across different cultures, making them a valuable means for collecting data for smart cities due to data availability and the easy scalability of their applications.
